## Example Test Session

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GEMINI_API_KEY not found"**

   - Make sure you have a `.env` file with your API key
   - Check that the key is valid

2. **"Module not found"**

   - Make sure you're in the correct directory
   - Install dependencies with `pip install -e .`

3. **"Redis connection error"**
   - Redis is optional for conversation history
   - The agent will work without Redis, just won't save conversation history

### Debug Mode

Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in your `.env` file for more detailed logging.

## Test Scenarios

Try these test messages:

- "Hello!"
- "What products do you have?"
- "Tell me about wireless headphones"
- "I want to place an order"
- "What's my order status?"
- "I need to cancel an order"
- "Thank you!"
